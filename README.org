#+TITLE: Lablib.jl
* Welcome do =Lablib.jl= docs! 
** What is =Lablib.jl= ?
   =Lablib.jl= is a tool with the purpose of performing
   calculations often needed in =physical measures=, like
   uncertainty propagation.
   Although it uses =Measurements.jl=, some of functionalities
   had to be build up in a way that made more sense for our use.
** References 
   - [[https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/Measurements.jl][Measurements.jl]]
* TODO TODO 
  - Export results tabel in =LaTeX= 
  - Uncertainty propagation.





  

* Features
** Standart and average deviantion
   With a list =x= run the command:
   #+begin_src julia
     deviation(x);
   #+end_src
** Least squares 
   To make all the computations for the least squares
   method just run:
   #+begin_src julia
leastSquares(x,y)
#+end_src
   x, y are lists with same size.
